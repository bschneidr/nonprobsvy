nonprobMI_fit: Function for outcome variable estimation based on nonprobability sample and using model based approach}
\usage{
nonprobMI_fit(
  outcome,
  data,
  weights,
  svydesign,
  family_outcome,
  control_outcome = controlOut(),
  start = NULL,
  verbose,
  model,
  x,
  y
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{\itemize{
\item \code{formula}, the outcome equation.
}}

\item{data}{\itemize{
\item an optional \code{data.frame} with data from the nonprobability sample.
}}

\item{weights}{\itemize{
\item an optional \code{vector} of ‘prior weights’ to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector. It is assumed that this vector contains frequency or analytic weights
}}

\item{svydesign}{\itemize{
\item an optional \code{svydesign} object (from the survey package) containing probability sample.
}}

\item{family_outcome}{\itemize{
\item a \code{character} string describing the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. Default is "gaussian". Currently supports: gaussian with identity link, poisson and binomial.
}}

\item{control_outcome}{\itemize{
\item a
}}

\item{start}{\itemize{
\item a
}}

\item{verbose}{\itemize{
\item a
}}

\item{model}{\itemize{
\item a
